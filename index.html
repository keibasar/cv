  <h2>Documentary</h2>
  <h3>A Broken Crayon - 2016</h3>
  <p>This inspirational short documentary tells the story of tragedy and comeback journey of <strong>Azran Osman-Rani</strong>, a Malaysian business leader and an amateur Ironman triathlete, who was severely injured in a car crash while cycling. From
    the depths of despair, he musters the will to recover, the resilience to persevere and the determination to get back to triathlon racing in less than 6 months - so that he can teach his children that life will knock you down hard, but what counts
    is our ability to get back up.<br>Watch here: <a href="https://www.iflix.com/my/en/title/movie/185371">iFlix</a></p>
